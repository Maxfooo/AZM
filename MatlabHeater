%% AZM Heater

%% Constants
vdd = 3.3; % volts
W = 1; %watt
Vt = 1; % Volt - Threshold voltage of discrete trans.
railHigh = 3.3; % Volts - Vdd - Vt of Op Amp Transistors
Rs = 10; %Ohm - heater resistor
legs = 2; %number of heater transistors

%% Heater controller variables
sR = Rs/2; %Ohm - Source resistance
Vsmax = railHigh-Vt; % Volt - Maximum source voltage before cutoff
CurrMax = W/Vsmax/legs % Amps
Vslimit = CurrMax*sR

%% Heater limiter variables
R1 = 1000; % Ohms
h = Vslimit/(vdd-Vslimit);
R2 = h*R1



% When temperature is at its nominal (chosen) value, the source voltage
% should be at half its maximum value. This allows for swing up and down
% depending on the temp variation.
